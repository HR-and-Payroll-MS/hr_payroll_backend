# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest stable release of this project. Please ensure you are using the most recent version before reporting security issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open an issue**. Instead, please email the maintainers directly at [seudsahm1@gmaail.com](mailto:seudsahm1@gmaail.com) with the following information:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets

We will respond as quickly as possible and work with you to resolve the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly. We are committed to keeping our users safe and will credit you for your responsible disclosure if you wish.

## Security Best Practices

- Keep your dependencies up to date.
- Do not share sensitive configuration files (such as `.env` files) publicly.
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
- Review and follow [Django security best practices](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/security/).
